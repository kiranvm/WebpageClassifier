"even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," he said. snowden told the guardian newspaper in the united kingdom that he had access to the full rosters of everyone working at the nsa, the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the world. just watched legal risks for nsa whistleblower replay more videos ... must watch legal risks for nsa whistleblower  03:34 just watched pentagon papers whistleblower on nsa replay more videos ... must watch pentagon papers whistleblower on nsa  07:00 just watched obama answers outcry over nsa replay more videos ... must watch obama answers outcry over nsa  11:30 "i'm just another guy who sits there day to day in the office, watching what's happening, and goes, 'this is something that's not our place to decide.' the public needs to decide whether these programs or policies are right or wrong," he said. snowden fled to hong kong after copying one last set of documents and telling his boss he needed to go away for medical treatment. from hawaii to hiding before his leak of u.s. intelligence, snowden was living "in paradise." he worked for a major u.s. government contractor in hawaii, earning a six-figure salary and enjoying the scenic state with his girlfriend. he told the guardian he never received a high school diploma and didn't complete his computer studies at a community college. instead, he joined the army in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both legs in an accident. snowden said he later worked as a security guard for the nsa and then took a computer security job with the cia. he left that job in 2009 and moved on to booz allen hamilton, where he worked as a contractor for the government in hawaii. he told the guardian that he left for hong kong on may 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned.

"from a hawaii standpoint, good riddance, thanks for leaving," ralph cossa told cnn affiliate khon . "i'm sure the guy had an overactive mother teresa gene and thought he was going to go out and save america from americans, but in reality he was very foolish," cossa said. "we expect the government to honor our privacy, but we also expect our government to protect us from terrorist attacks." opinion: snowden is a hero the fallou t president barack obama insists his administration is not spying on u.s. citizens -- rather, it's only looking for information on terrorists. booz allen hamilton, the government contractor that employed snowden, said snowden had worked at the firm for less than three months. "news reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm," the company said in the statement. the firm said it will cooperate with authorities in their investigation. according to the guardian, the only time snowden became emotional during hours of interviews was when he thought about what might happen to his relatives -- many of whom work for the u.s. government. "the only thing i fear is the harmful effects on my family, who i won't be able to help anymore," he said. "that's what keeps me up at night." as for his concerns about his country, "the greatest fear that i have regarding the outcome for america of these disclosures is that nothing will change." read: some shrug at nsa snooping: privacy's already dead obama: no one listening to your calls official: damage assessment over u.s. intelligence-gathering leaks powered by livefyre  search us crime + justice energy + environment extreme weather space + science world africa americas asia australia china europe india middle east united kingdom politics 45 congress scotus facts first 2020 2019 elections business markets tech media success perspectives videos opinion political op-eds social commentary health food fitness wellness parenting vital signs entertainment stars screen binge culture media tech innovate gadget mission: ahead upstarts work transformed innovative cities style arts design fashion architecture luxury autos video travel destinations food & drink play stay videos sports pro football college football basketball baseball soccer olympics videos live tv digital studios cnn films hln tv schedule tv shows a-z cnnvr coupons cnn underscored explore wellness gadgets lifestyle cnn store more photos longform investigations cnn profiles cnn leadership cnn newsletters work for cnn follow cnn politics terms of use privacy policy accessibility & cc adchoices about us cnn studio tours cnn store newsletters transcripts license footage cnn newsource sitemap © 2019 cable news network. turner broadcasting system, inc. all rights reserved. cnn sans ™ & © 2016 cable news network.
